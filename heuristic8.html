															<h2>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h2>
															<span class="byline">"Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility." - Jakob Nielsen</span>
														</header>

														<p>An aesthetic and minimalist approach is an important aspect for website design because it allows users to more efficiently complete their goals. Extra content can be distracting or may confuse a user. An organized website with only the most important and necessary information aids a user best in their search for certain material.</p>

																<h3>Disorganization of sections</h3>
																<p>The frontpage of the site contains many different blocks that are organized into cramped and somewhat nonsensical sections. The main banner at the top of the page features a “Discovery” section, which highlights one single study that is being done presumably at the university. Two boxes below feature news, but the next section of blocks cover a range of topics, including “Discovery” again, although this block features a single student and his interests in science and sports. There is also a poorly designed navigation bar to the left of these blocks which have links that lead to areas that are not mentioned in the blocks at all. Only some of the blocks in the section have an overlay that pop up when the user mouses over the section. The frontpage also seems to have two footers. On closer inspection, the top footer contains reviews of the university, but it is completely unclear when the slider returns to the first slide. The bottom footer contains information that can be found in the second navigation bar located at the top of the page, but not all the links are present in the bottom footer; the selection seems arbitrary, and it is unclear why certain links were included while others were not.</p>

																<h3>Navigation to unknown sections</h3>
																<p>In the middle of the page on the left and right edges, two buttons take the user to the previous and next sections, respectively. It is impossible to know which sections can be reached through these buttons. The user can only see the immediately previous and next sections; the only way to see which sections are displayed in this fashion is to cycle through the sections. After clicking through the pages, it is evident there are only two other pages that are linked to the homepage by way of these two navigation buttons: “Colleges & Schools” and “Admissions & Campus Life”. However, it is unclear as to how or why these sections were chosen to be displayed in such a manner. Additionally, these two topics are also separate links contained in the both of the navigation bars, although clicking on those links lead the user to a completely different page compared to the pages reached by the previous and next buttons in the middle of the page.</p>

															</div>
															<div class="8u">
																<h3>Overwhelming amount of links</h3>
																<p>There are two different toolbars located at the top of page, containing different information. The first toolbar is dedicated to students and faculty who are already affiliated with the university, and the second toolbar contains other general information about the university. However, some of the information is poorly distributed. For instance, a current student at the university who wants to peruse the majors offered and select a major would not use the first navigation bar for current students. The user would have to select the correct link from the “Academics” tab located in the second navigation bar. The links contained in each navigation bar compete with one another and their placements may confuse the user when they are trying to search for certain information. Additionally, there is an overwhelming amount of links that pop up once a user hovers over a tab. With this amount of links, a user can be easily confused when attempting to navigate through the site. Furthermore, some but not all of the links are displayed again at the bottom of the page.</p>
